Push_swap : Because Swap_push isnâ€™t as natural | Officially finished at 2023-12-13 / Grade: 96 of 100

In this project you will learn to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To be successful, you will have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

Allowed stack movements to sort the data:

The way the sorting algorithm is evaluated will depend on the total movements it executes for different numbers:
- For 3 input values: No more than 3 moves are allowed.
- For 5 input values: No more than 12 moves are allowed.
- For 100 input values: Scored from 1 to 5 depending on the number of moves executed.
      - 5 points. Performed moves <= 700
      - 4 points. 700 < movements <= 900
      - 3 points. 900 < movements <= 1100
      - 2 points. 1100 < movements <= 1300
      - 1 point. 1300 < movements <= 1500
- For 500 input values: Scored from 1 to 5 depending on the number of moves executed.
      - 5 points. Performed movements <= 5500
      - 4 points. 5500 < movements <= 7000
      - 3 points. 7000 < movements <= 8500
      - 2 points. 8500 < movements <= 10000
      - 1 point. 10000 < movements <= 11500
